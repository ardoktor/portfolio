# Later Implementation

- Blog tag filtering: `?tag=mulakat-pro` param on blog list view needs backend support (add `tag` field to BlogPost model, filter in BlogListView)
- Project page links: "Project" tags on about page currently link to `/projects/` general page -- should deep-link to specific project (anchor or slug-based URL)
- Projects page: still uses old dark theme styling, needs full restyle to match design_theme.md
- Blog page: still uses old dark theme, needs restyle
- Contact page: still uses old dark theme, needs restyle
- ConsulDent and mulakat.pro demo_link URLs are placeholders (consuldent.com, mulakat.pro) -- update with real URLs when live
- MentAI demo_link (mentai.app) is placeholder -- update when live
