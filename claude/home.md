1️⃣ AI & Automation

(En güçlü alanın → daha net ownership vurgusu)

Title:
AI & Automation

Text (replace completely):

I design and build AI-assisted systems that automate complex workflows.
My work includes LLM-powered tools, RAG-based knowledge systems, and
voice-driven pipelines that turn unstructured input into structured outputs.

I focus on practical AI: systems that reduce operational friction,
support real users, and integrate cleanly into backend architectures.


👉 Neden iyi?

“build GPT-powered tools” → design and build systems

RAG + voice → CV’deki Whisper / LangGraph çizgisi

AI’yi “oyuncak” değil “operasyonel” gösteriyor

2️⃣ Backend Engineering

(Öğreniyorum değil → sahipleniyorum)

Title:
Backend Engineering

Text:

I build backend systems using Python, Django, and FastAPI,
with a strong focus on data models, APIs, and workflow orchestration.

I enjoy turning product requirements into reliable backend logic —
from database design and integrations to deployment, CI/CD,
and production-ready services.


👉 Neden iyi?

Firebase / Functions vs. detayına boğulmuyor

Product → backend translation net

Senior backend hissi

3️⃣ MVP & Startup Building

(Burası senin imzan, biraz daha sert olmalı)

Title:
MVP & Startup Building

Text:

I take ideas from problem discovery to shipped MVPs with real users.
I own the full product lifecycle — design, implementation, deployment,
and iteration — focusing on fast validation and real-world impact.

Healthcare, education, and interview preparation products I built
are currently used and evolving based on user feedback.


👉 Neden çok güçlü?

“develop full-stack MVPs” → own the full lifecycle

“real users” tekrar tekrar vurgulanıyor

Founder + Product Engineer netleşiyor

4️⃣ Research & Data Science

(Akademik ama ürünle bağlantılı)

Title:
Research & Data Science

Text:

I have a background in applied data science and research,
working on topics such as anomaly detection, NLP, and user behavior analysis.

My approach blends analytical thinking with product needs —
using data not just for insight, but to inform decisions,
automation, and system design.


👉 Neden dengeli?

Akademik geçmiş var ama ürünle kopuk değil

“research person” değil → engineering-minded analyst
