I’m Arda — a product-focused software engineer who builds AI-assisted
systems around real operational problems.

My background spans network infrastructure and backend engineering,
but my core strength lies in designing intelligent workflows:
systems that combine LLMs, retrieval, and automation to support
real users in healthcare, education, and career development.
I don’t build demos — I build products.
From clinical knowledge systems (ConsulDent),
to long-term mentorship journeys (MentAI),
to resume and interview gap analysis (mulakat.pro),
my work consistently revolves around the same question:

“How can AI reduce complexity and guide better decisions?”
I’m deeply focused on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
agent-based architectures, and structured AI outputs.
I care about correctness, traceability, and usability —
not just model outputs, but how those outputs fit
into real workflows.
Every project I build is treated as a potential product.
That means owning the full lifecycle:
system design, backend logic, deployment,
iteration, and continuous improvement based on user feedback.
Below are the tools and systems I actively use.
They’re not just part of my stack —
they’re the foundation of the products I ship.
