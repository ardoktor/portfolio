🎓 Education
Yaşar University

B.Sc. Electrical & Electronics Engineering
2017 – 2021
GPA: 3.42 / 4.00
Scholarship: 100%

Studied core electrical and electronics engineering disciplines,
with a strong focus on systems thinking, signal processing,
and applied engineering problem-solving.

My academic work emphasized how complex physical systems
can be modeled, optimized, and controlled —
a mindset that later translated directly
into backend systems, automation, and AI-driven architectures.

Yaşar University

B.Sc. Energy Systems Engineering
2016 – 2020
GPA: 3.72 / 4.00 (Highest GPA in cohort)

Focused on energy production, distribution, and optimization,
with particular interest in efficiency-driven system design
and demand-side management.

Graduation work centered on a
Smart Home Energy Demand Management System,
exploring how real-time consumption data,
optimization logic, and control mechanisms
can reduce energy usage while preserving user comfort.

This work strengthened my ability to:
• model real-world systems
• reason about constraints and trade-offs
• design data-driven decision mechanisms

İzmir Atatürk Lisesi

2011 – 2015
Boarding Student (Dormitory)

Completed my high school education as a boarding student,
living independently in İzmir from an early age.

Dormitory life played a significant role
in developing discipline, responsibility,
and self-management —
skills that later proved essential
in both engineering and entrepreneurship.
