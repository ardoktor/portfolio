MentAI — Personalized Learning & Mentorship Platform
MentAI is a personalized education and mentorship system
designed to support long-term cognitive and behavioral development.

The core problem it addresses is continuity:
most learning tools treat users as stateless,
forgetting context, goals, and progress over time.

MentAI was my first end-to-end product where I actively combined
backend engineering, AI-assisted reasoning, and product thinking
into a single system.

More importantly, it was the project that introduced me
to entrepreneurship and real-world product development.

System Philosophy
MentAI is not a content platform.
It is a guidance system.

The system is built around persistence:
user history, feedback, and actions are treated
as structured, evolving state rather than disposable input.

Every interaction feeds the next one.
The goal is not one good answer,
but sustained guidance over time.

Core Capabilities
Long-Term User Modeling
User reflections, feedback, and responses
are stored as structured data models.

This enables:
• progress tracking across weeks and months
• pattern detection in behavior and motivation
• adaptive guidance instead of static content

Structured Guidance & Workflows
MentAI delivers guidance through repeatable workflows:
daily prompts, reflection questions,
task suggestions, and periodic evaluations.

Outputs are designed to be actionable and contextual,
not generic motivational text.

AI-Assisted Reasoning
LLMs are used as reasoning components,
not as the product itself.

They assist with:
• summarizing user input
• extracting structured signals
• shaping future guidance

Generation is controlled through structured pipelines
to ensure consistency and predictability.

Backend & Cloud Architecture
MentAI was built as a backend-first system
using Python-based services and cloud-native components.

Google Cloud Functions were used to:
• handle event-driven logic
• process user inputs asynchronously
• trigger scheduled and conditional workflows

This architecture helped me design stateless execution units
on top of stateful data models —
a pattern I later reused across other products.

Product & Entrepreneurship Journey
MentAI was my first real exposure to entrepreneurship
beyond writing code.

We formed a small team,
developed the product collaboratively,
and actively engaged in early-stage startup communities.

As part of the project:
• we built and managed an Instagram page
  to communicate the product vision
• we participated in the Karşıyaka Girişimcilik Merkezi collective
• we discussed the product with other founders,
  mentors, and early users

Although MentAI did not fully proceed as a startup,
it fundamentally shaped how I think about products:
validation, iteration, communication,
and building with real constraints.

What I Built End-to-End
• User state and history models
• Structured guidance workflows
• LLM-assisted analysis pipelines
• Event-driven backend logic (Cloud Functions)
• APIs and persistence layers
• Deployment, iteration, and user feedback loops

Why MentAI Matters (Personally & Technically)
MentAI represents the point where I stopped
thinking like a developer working on features
and started thinking like a product builder.

It taught me how technical decisions,
user behavior, and product direction
are tightly connected.

Many of the architectural patterns and product instincts
I apply today in ConsulDent and mulakat.pro
originated in this project.
