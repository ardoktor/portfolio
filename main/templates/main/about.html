      <h2>A Bit About How I Work</h2>
      <p>I'm Arda -- a product-focused software engineer who builds AI-assisted systems around real operational problems.</p>
      <p>My background spans network infrastructure and backend engineering, but my core strength lies in designing intelligent workflows: systems that combine LLMs, retrieval, and automation to support real users in healthcare, education, and career development. I don't build demos -- I build products. From clinical knowledge systems (ConsulDent), to long-term mentorship journeys (MentAI), to resume and interview gap analysis (mulakat.pro), my work consistently revolves around the same question:</p>
      <p><strong>"How can AI reduce complexity and guide better decisions?"</strong></p>
      <p>I'm deeply focused on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agent-based architectures, and structured AI outputs. I care about correctness, traceability, and usability -- not just model outputs, but how those outputs fit into real workflows.</p>
      <p>Every project I build is treated as a potential product. That means owning the full lifecycle: system design, backend logic, deployment, iteration, and continuous improvement based on user feedback.</p>
      <p class="text-muted-theme">Below are the tools and systems I actively use. They're not just part of my stack -- they're the foundation of the products I ship.</p>

          <h3 class="h5 fw-bold">Founder & Developer, ConsulDent</h3>
          <p>A domain-specific AI-assisted system designed to support dentists in daily clinical workflows, knowledge retrieval, and decision preparation. The core challenge it addresses is not lack of information, but fragmentation: clinical knowledge exists across books, guidelines, documents, and personal notes -- disconnected from the dentist's actual workflow.</p>
          <p>I built ConsulDent as a backend-first, knowledge-centric system that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structured outputs, and workflow-aware reasoning into a single product. The goal is not to replace clinical judgment, but to reduce cognitive load and friction around documentation, preparation, and reference lookup.</p>
          <p><strong>System Philosophy</strong></p>
          <p>ConsulDent is not a chat interface. It is a clinical support system. Every response is designed to be grounded in retrievable sources, structured for clinical usability, and aligned with real-world dental workflows. The system decomposes clinical interactions into retrieval, reasoning, and output layers -- allowing accuracy, traceability, and domain control to remain first-class concerns.</p>
          <p><strong>Core Capabilities</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Knowledge-Centric Retrieval (RAG):</strong> Clinical books, guidelines, and reference documents are indexed and retrieved as first-class sources. Queries are resolved through retrieval-augmented pipelines ensuring section-aware responses, reduced hallucination risk, and consistent terminology.</li>
            <li><strong>Workflow-Oriented Outputs:</strong> Visit preparation summaries, treatment explanations, clinical notes and documentation drafts, presentation-ready content for patient communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Agent-Oriented Reasoning:</strong> Complex tasks handled through agent-like flows -- retrieval, reasoning, validation, and formatting as separate steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice & Multimodal Input:</strong> Voice-based input for real clinical environments where typing is impractical. Speech transformed into structured, actionable data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>ConsulDent Clinic (Operational Layer)</strong></p>
          <p>Extends the knowledge system into day-to-day clinical operations: visit lifecycle tracking, task coordination, structured documentation outputs, and reducing administrative overhead. This layer bridges clinical reasoning with operational execution.</p>
          <p><strong>What I Built End-to-End</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Domain-specific RAG pipelines</li>
            <li>Knowledge ingestion and indexing logic</li>
            <li>Agent-style reasoning flows</li>
            <li>Structured output generation</li>
            <li>Voice-to-structure processing</li>
            <li>Backend APIs and data models</li>
            <li>Deployment, iteration, and product evolution</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Why ConsulDent Matters</strong></p>
          <p>ConsulDent represents how I approach AI products: as systems, not features. It combines domain expertise, backend engineering, and AI-assisted reasoning to solve real operational problems. This is the most complete expression of my architectural mindset.</p>

          <p>An AI-assisted interview preparation system designed to identify skill gaps, structure learning paths, and simulate real interview expectations. The core problem it solves is not "mock interviews" -- it's decision ambiguity: candidates don't know what to study, in what order, or how close they are to being interview-ready.</p>
          <p>I designed mulakat.pro as a backend-first system that analyzes resumes and job requirements, extracts structured signals, and maps them into actionable preparation steps. The platform focuses on gap detection between candidate profiles and job roles, structured topic breakdowns instead of generic advice, and AI-assisted evaluation with explainable outputs.</p>
          <p><strong>System Design & Architecture</strong></p>
          <p>The system is built around retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and structured reasoning pipelines. Job descriptions, resumes, and domain knowledge are processed as retrievable sources rather than raw prompts. Agent-like flows separate concerns: analysis, evaluation, feedback generation, and preparation guidance are handled as distinct steps instead of a single LLM call.</p>
          <p><strong>What I Built</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Resume and job-post parsing pipelines</li>
            <li>Skill and requirement extraction logic</li>
            <li>Gap analysis and readiness estimation</li>
            <li>Structured interview topic generation</li>
            <li>Backend APIs for evaluation and progress tracking</li>
            <li>Deployment and iteration based on real user feedback</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Why This Project Matters</strong></p>
          <p>mulakat.pro reflects how I approach AI products in general: not as chat interfaces, but as decision-support systems. The goal is not to "sound smart", but to guide users through complex processes with clarity, structure, and measurable progress.</p>

          <h3 class="h5 fw-bold">Founder & Developer, MentAI</h3>
          <p>A personalized education and mentorship system designed to support long-term cognitive and behavioral development. The core problem it addresses is continuity: most learning tools treat users as stateless, forgetting context, goals, and progress over time.</p>
          <p>MentAI was my first end-to-end product where I actively combined backend engineering, AI-assisted reasoning, and product thinking into a single system. More importantly, it was the project that introduced me to entrepreneurship and real-world product development.</p>
          <p><strong>System Philosophy</strong></p>
          <p>MentAI is not a content platform. It is a guidance system. The system is built around persistence: user history, feedback, and actions are treated as structured, evolving state rather than disposable input. Every interaction feeds the next one. The goal is not one good answer, but sustained guidance over time.</p>
          <p><strong>Core Capabilities</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Long-Term User Modeling:</strong> User reflections, feedback, and responses stored as structured data models -- enabling progress tracking, pattern detection in behavior, and adaptive guidance.</li>
            <li><strong>Structured Guidance & Workflows:</strong> Daily prompts, reflection questions, task suggestions, and periodic evaluations. Outputs designed to be actionable and contextual, not generic motivational text.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Assisted Reasoning:</strong> LLMs used as reasoning components -- summarizing user input, extracting structured signals, and shaping future guidance through controlled pipelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Backend & Cloud Architecture:</strong> Google Cloud Functions for event-driven logic, asynchronous input processing, and scheduled workflows. Stateless execution units on top of stateful data models.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Product & Entrepreneurship Journey</strong></p>
          <p>MentAI was my first real exposure to entrepreneurship beyond writing code. We formed a small team, developed the product collaboratively, and actively engaged in early-stage startup communities. We built and managed an Instagram page to communicate the product vision, participated in the Karsiyaka Girisimcilik Merkezi collective, and discussed the product with other founders, mentors, and early users.</p>
          <p><strong>What I Built End-to-End</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>User state and history models</li>
            <li>Structured guidance workflows</li>
            <li>LLM-assisted analysis pipelines</li>
            <li>Event-driven backend logic (Cloud Functions)</li>
            <li>APIs and persistence layers</li>
            <li>Deployment, iteration, and user feedback loops</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Why MentAI Matters</strong></p>
          <p>MentAI represents the point where I stopped thinking like a developer working on features and started thinking like a product builder. It taught me how technical decisions, user behavior, and product direction are tightly connected. Many of the architectural patterns and product instincts I apply today in ConsulDent and mulakat.pro originated in this project.</p>
