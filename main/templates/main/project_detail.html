      <!-- Block 1: The Problem -->
      <div class="dd-card dd-narrative" data-aos="fade-up">

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Most learning tools treat users as stateless — forgetting context, goals, and progress over time. MentAI targets continuity: building a system that remembers where a learner is, what they struggle with, and what they need next — without turning everything into a chat history.</p>
        <p>MentAI was my first end-to-end product where I combined backend engineering, AI-assisted reasoning, and product thinking into one system. More importantly, it introduced me to entrepreneurship and real-world product development through building as a team and engaging early startup communities.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Block 2: Continuity as a Systems Constraint -->
      <div class="dd-card dd-technical" data-aos="fade-up">

        <h3>Continuity as a Systems Constraint</h3>
        <h4>Constraints I designed for</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Stateful guidance (progress, goals, patterns) on top of stateless execution (serverless)</li>
          <li>Unstructured user input &rarr; structured signals</li>
          <li>Repeatable loop: input &rarr; analysis &rarr; guidance &rarr; action &rarr; feedback</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>System loop</h4>
        <div class="dd-flow">input -> normalize -> extract signals -> update user_state
     -> generate guidance -> assign actions -> collect feedback</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Block 3: System Philosophy -->
      <div class="dd-card dd-narrative" data-aos="fade-up">

        <h3>System Philosophy</h3>
        <p>MentAI is not a content platform. It is a guidance system. The product is built around persistence: user history, feedback, and actions are treated as structured, evolving state rather than disposable input. Each interaction feeds the next one. The goal is not one good answer — it's sustained guidance over time.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Block 4: State Model -->
      <div class="dd-card dd-technical" data-aos="fade-up">

        <h3>State Model</h3>
        <h4>Core entities</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>user_profile (stable)</li>
          <li>goals (explicit targets)</li>
          <li>daily_inputs (mood / energy / notes)</li>
          <li>actions_tasks (assigned + completed)</li>
          <li>progress_signals (habit streaks, friction points)</li>
          <li>weekly_summary (compressed memory)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why structured state beats raw chat</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Queryable (progress tracking)</li>
          <li>Explainable (why this suggestion?)</li>
          <li>Safer outputs (less randomness)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Block 5: Core Capabilities -->
      <div class="dd-card dd-narrative" data-aos="fade-up">

        <h3>Core Capabilities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Long-Term User Modeling:</strong> Reflections and feedback are stored as structured data to enable progress tracking and adaptive guidance.</li>
          <li><strong>Structured Guidance & Workflows:</strong> Daily prompts, reflection questions, task suggestions, and periodic evaluations — designed to be actionable, not motivational filler.</li>
          <li><strong>AI-Assisted Reasoning:</strong> LLMs are used as reasoning components to summarize input, extract signals, and shape future guidance through controlled pipelines.</li>
          <li><strong>Backend & Cloud Architecture:</strong> Event-driven logic powers asynchronous processing, scheduled nudges, and background evaluations.</li>

      <div class="dd-card dd-narrative" data-aos="fade-up">

        <h3>What Didn't Work & What I Learned</h3>
        <p>Not everything worked. The hardest part wasn't generating content — it was sustaining engagement, balancing structure with flexibility, and building a real feedback loop early. MentAI taught me that a well-designed system doesn't automatically create product-market fit. Distribution, messaging, and iteration speed matter as much as architecture.</p>
        <p>MentAI also introduced me to entrepreneurship: we built as a team, grew an Instagram presence, and participated in the Kar&#351;&#305;yaka Giri&#351;imcilik Merkezi collective. Even though it didn't proceed as a full startup, it shaped my product instincts and directly influenced how I later built mulakat.pro and ConsulDent.</p>

        <div class="dd-fix-solution">fix: allow "free input" + structured extraction later</div>

        <div class="dd-fix-problem">Hard to measure progress</div>

      <!-- Block 11: Community & Go-to-Market -->
      <div class="dd-card dd-narrative" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>Community, Go-to-Market & Early Validation</h3>
        <p>MentAI was developed collaboratively with close friends as part of a small, self-organized team. Beyond technical development, we actively worked on validation, visibility, and early community building — treating the project as a real product rather than a prototype.</p>
        <p>We participated in two entrepreneurship-focused conferences, where we presented MentAI publicly, shared the product vision, and discussed our approach with founders, mentors, and early-stage teams.</p>
        <p>As part of the Kar&#351;&#305;yaka Giri&#351;imcilik Merkezi collective, we engaged with local startup communities, exchanged feedback with other teams, and gained first-hand exposure to early-stage product challenges beyond code.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Block 12: User Research & Brand -->
      <div class="dd-card dd-technical" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>User Research & Brand Work</h3>
        <h4>User Research & Feedback</h4>
        <p>We conducted surveys and informal user interviews to better understand learning habits, motivation patterns, and pain points.</p>
        <p>These insights directly influenced:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How guidance was structured</li>
          <li>How frequently the system interacted with users</li>
          <li>Which features were prioritized or dropped</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Brand & Content Work</h4>
        <p>We built and managed MentAI's Instagram presence as an experiment in early distribution and communication.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designing visual posts and short-form content</li>
          <li>Producing and sharing reels</li>
          <li>Communicating the product philosophy publicly</li>
          <li>Testing which messages resonated with users</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Through this process, we developed a clear brand identity, completed logo design and brand approval, and learned how product positioning directly affects user engagement.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Block 13: Why This Experience Matters -->
      <div class="dd-card dd-narrative" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>Why This Experience Matters</h3>
        <p>This phase of MentAI taught me that building a product is not only a technical challenge. Validation, communication, design, and distribution are tightly coupled with system decisions. Many of the product instincts I apply today — especially around clarity, structure, and user focus — originated from this experience.</p>
        <p>Even though MentAI did not proceed as a full startup, the lessons from this phase became foundational for how I later approached mulakat.pro and ConsulDent.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The core challenge ConsulDent addresses is not lack of information, but <strong>fragmentation</strong>: clinical knowledge exists across books, guidelines, documents, and personal notes — disconnected from the dentist's actual workflow.</p>
        <p>I built ConsulDent as a backend-first, knowledge-centric system that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structured outputs, and workflow-aware reasoning into a single product. The goal is not to replace clinical judgment, but to reduce cognitive load and friction around documentation, preparation, and reference lookup.</p>

        <h3>Core Capabilities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Knowledge-Centric Retrieval (RAG):</strong> Clinical books, guidelines, and reference documents are indexed and retrieved as first-class sources with section-aware responses.</li>
          <li><strong>Workflow-Oriented Outputs:</strong> Visit preparation summaries, treatment explanations, clinical notes, and patient communication content.</li>
          <li><strong>Agent-Oriented Reasoning:</strong> Complex tasks handled through retrieval, reasoning, validation, and formatting as separate steps.</li>
          <li><strong>Voice & Multimodal Input:</strong> Voice-based input for real clinical environments where typing is impractical.</li>

        <h3>Why ConsulDent Matters</h3>
        <p>ConsulDent represents how I approach AI products: as <strong>systems, not features</strong>. It combines domain expertise, backend engineering, and AI-assisted reasoning to solve real operational problems. This is the most complete expression of my architectural mindset.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The core problem mulakat.pro solves is not "mock interviews" — it's <strong>decision ambiguity</strong>: candidates don't know what to study, in what order, or how close they are to being interview-ready.</p>
        <p>I designed mulakat.pro as a backend-first system that analyzes resumes and job requirements, extracts structured signals, and maps them into actionable preparation steps.</p>

      <div class="dd-card dd-technical" data-aos="fade-up">

        <h3>System Design & Architecture</h3>
        <p>Built around RAG and structured reasoning pipelines. Job descriptions, resumes, and domain knowledge are processed as retrievable sources rather than raw prompts.</p>
        <h4>Separation of concerns</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Analysis — resume + job post parsing</li>
          <li>Evaluation — gap detection + readiness scoring</li>
          <li>Feedback — structured, explainable output</li>
          <li>Guidance — preparation steps + topic generation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I Built</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Resume and job-post parsing pipelines</li>
          <li>Skill and requirement extraction logic</li>
          <li>Gap analysis and readiness estimation</li>
          <li>Structured interview topic generation</li>
          <li>Backend APIs for evaluation and progress tracking</li>
          <li>Deployment and iteration based on real user feedback</li>

        <h3>Why This Project Matters</h3>
        <p>mulakat.pro reflects how I approach AI products in general: not as chat interfaces, but as <strong>decision-support systems</strong>. The goal is not to "sound smart", but to guide users through complex processes with clarity, structure, and measurable progress.</p>
