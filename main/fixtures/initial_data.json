      "description": "This repository is a curated collection of my hands-on data science mini-projects, built to deepen my skills across the core areas of data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and storytelling with data. Each project is structured around real-world datasets, aiming to replicate challenges and scenarios that a data scientist might encounter in the industry.\r\n\r\nThroughout these projects, I apply techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and visualization. I also experiment with various machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks are explored through classification and zero-shot learning approaches, demonstrating the flexibility of modern AI tools.\r\n\r\nThe repository showcases my ability to move beyond textbook examples, applying analytical thinking, critical evaluation, and creative problem-solving to open-ended challenges.\r\n\r\nProject Highlights:\r\n\r\nMovie Ratings Bias Detection: Explored biases in movie rating systems by analyzing the Fandango dataset, applying statistical analysis and visualization to detect systematic rating inflation.\r\n\r\nTraffic Pattern Anomaly Analysis: Built an LSTM-based anomaly detection model to uncover unusual traffic behaviors based on time-series data, demonstrating advanced sequence modeling techniques.\r\n\r\nImage Classification with CNNs: Implemented convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify CIFAR image data, focusing on improving accuracy through data augmentation and fine-tuning architectures.\r\n\r\nZero-Shot Text Classification: Developed a text classification system capable of categorizing documents without labeled training examples, using cutting-edge zero-shot learning strategies.\r\n\r\nPredictive Modeling for Diabetes and Bike Sharing Demand: Built machine learning regression and classification models to predict health outcomes (diabetes diagnosis) and bike rental demand based on various environmental and user features.",
